                            <h3> (Jan. - May.2023)</h3>
                            <p>This project explores the novel application of transfer learning techniques in classifying dogs' emotions, utilizing a combined dataset of 19,921 dog images from Kaggle (&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielshanbalico/dog-emotion" target="_blank">Dataset1</a> &&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devzohaib/dog-emotions-prediction?select=images" target="_blank">Dataset2</a>). Key methodologies include experimenting with various pretrained models like ResNet50, classifier modifications (e.g., SVM, KNN), multi-task learning, fine-tuning, and unsupervised domain adaptation. The study aims to enhance the understanding of dog emotions for better pet care, overcoming challenges like data imbalance and subjective labeling. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in improving training accuracy, with SVM emerging as a particularly effective classifier, although challenges such as overfitting and limited testing accuracy present areas for further research and improvement. This innovative approach offers significant potential in the realm of animal sentiment analysis, particularly benefiting dog owners by providing deeper insights into their pets' emotional states.</p>

                            <p>This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis to discern the relationship between complaint sentiments and loan types, focusing on student and vehicle loans. Utilizing a dataset from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=3y&date_received_max=2023-11-27&date_received_min=2020-11-27&lens=Product&searchField=all&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trends" target="_blank">Consumer Complaint Database</a>), the team applies various data science techniques, including sentiment analysis, hypothesis testing, and classification models, in R. They aim to identify differences in the proportion of negative words in loan-related complaints and develop predictive models to categorize complaints accurately. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, quantifying narrative sentiments, and applying statistical tests and Naive Bayes classifiers. The findings indicate subtle differences in sentiments between the two loan types, offering insights into customer experiences and perceptions in the financial sector.</p>

                            <h3>(Mar.2023)</h3>
                            <p>This project aims to revolutionize the way law consulting requests are processed by introducing a method to evaluate and prioritize cases based on urgency. Utilizing a novel combination of machine learning for case categorization and sentiment analysis, the project develops a dual-factor urgency assessment model. This model assigns urgency levels to cases by considering the case category and the emotional tone of the text. Categories such as health and housing are given higher urgency, while sentiment scores provide a nuanced understanding of client emotions. By multiplying these two urgency factors, the system effectively identifies cases that require immediate attention. This methodology not only optimizes resource allocation among ABA lawyers but also enhances client satisfaction and trust in legal services. The project also suggests implementing automatic response systems and clear communication strategies to help clients articulate their issues more effectively, further refining the urgency assessment process.</p>

                            <h3>(Jun. - Aug.2022)</h3>
                            <p>This project delves into the critical challenge of optimizing honey bee colony health and maximizing honey production through a detailed data-driven analysis. Utilizing datasets from the National Agricultural Statistical Services (NASS) (&nbsp;<a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/hd76s004z?locale=en" target="_blank">Honey Production dataset</a> &&nbsp;<a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d" target="_blank">Bee Colony and Stressors dataset</a>) and incorporating environmental and economic variables, the study aims to uncover the most effective methods for reducing bee colony losses and enhancing honey yield per colony. The research meticulously examines correlations between colony loss percentages, yield efficiencies, and various influencing factors, including climate data, state GDP, and specific stressors like Pesticides. By employing sophisticated modeling techniques, the project provides valuable insights for beekeepers and policymakers, highlighting key factors such as Varroa Mites, temperature variations, and other environmental stressors. The findings not only offer a pathway to healthier bee colonies and more efficient honey production but also contribute significantly to understanding the complex dynamics affecting these vital pollinators in the ecosystem.</p>
